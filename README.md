## Working on cleaning up the code (stay tuned) :)

# Digital-diary
terminal based diary software 

A simple diary software for storing everyday activities.

# Flaws
[1] It doesnt use encryption and all the details are stored in plain text.

[2] The folders are hidden and because of this the data can be accessible even without the program

[3] Doesn't work for windows

[4] There might be many bugs in it
